## Terark modified RocksDB

We forked RocksDB and made a few changes, here is [Terark modified RocksDB](http://github/rockeet/rocksdb).

Our changes for RocksDB does not change any RocksDB API, and does not incurred any extra dependencies, say, Terark modified RocksDB does not depend on TerarkZipTable. Our changes includes:

  1. Add optional two pass scan on SSTable build, existing SSTable is not impacted.
  
 Â 2. Add [TerarkZipTable config by env var](), this change using functions in libterark-zip-table as weak symbol, this is why it does not depends on TerarkZipTable.

## TerarkZipTable

TerarkZipTable is an SSTable implementation using  &copy;Terark&trade; algorithms for RocksDB. It must work with [Terark modified RocksDB](http://github/rockeet/rocksdb).
