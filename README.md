# TerocksDB 

TerocksDB is a core product from [Terark](http://www.terark.com). It is a RocksDB distribution that powered by TerarkDB's algorithms.

With our unique and cutting-edge algorithms, TerocksDB is able to store more data and access much faster than RocksDB(3+X more data and 10+X faster).

TerocksDB is completely compitable with official RocksDB, we didn't its existing behavior, just added a new SSTable implemention to it.
